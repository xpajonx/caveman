A [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skill that makes Claude talk like a caveman — cutting **~75% of tokens** while keeping full technical accuracy.

Based on the viral observation that caveman-speak dramatically reduces LLM token usage without losing technical substance. So we made it a one-line install.

## Before / After

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🗣️ Normal Claude (69 tokens)

> "The reason your React component is re-rendering is likely because you're creating a new object reference on each render cycle. When you pass an inline object as a prop, React's shallow comparison sees it as a different object every time, which triggers a re-render. I'd recommend using useMemo to memoize the object."

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🪨 Caveman Claude (19 tokens)

> "New object ref each render. Inline object prop = new ref = re-render. Wrap in `useMemo`."

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

### 🗣️ Normal Claude

> "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. The issue you're experiencing is most likely caused by your authentication middleware not properly validating the token expiry. Let me take a look and suggest a fix."

</td>
<td>

### 🪨 Caveman Claude

> "Bug in auth middleware. Token expiry check use `<` not `<=`. Fix:"

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Same fix. 75% less word. Brain still big.**

## Install

```bash
claude install-skill JuliusBrussee/caveman
```

One rock. That it.

## Usage

Trigger with:
- `/caveman`
- "talk like caveman"
- "caveman mode"
- "less tokens please"

Stop with: "stop caveman" or "normal mode"

## What Caveman Do

| Thing | Caveman Do? |
|-------|------------|
| English explanation | 🪨 Caveman smash filler words |
| Code blocks | ✍️ Write normal (caveman not stupid) |
| Technical terms | 🧠 Keep exact (polymorphism stay polymorphism) |
| Error messages | 📋 Quote exact |
| Git commits & PRs | ✍️ Write normal |
| Articles (a, an, the) | 💀 Gone |
| Pleasantries | 💀 "Sure I'd be happy to" is dead |
| Hedging | 💀 "It might be worth considering" extinct |

## Why

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TOKENS SAVED          ████████ 75% │
│  TECHNICAL ACCURACY    ████████ 100%│
│  SPEED INCREASE        ████████ ~3x │
│  VIBES                 ████████ OOG │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Save money** — 75% less token = 75% less cost on output
- **Faster response** — less token to generate = speed go brrr
- **Same accuracy** — all technical info kept, only fluff removed
- **Fun** — every code review become comedy

## How It Work

Caveman not dumb. Caveman **efficient**.

Normal LLM waste token on:
- "I'd be happy to help you with that" (8 wasted tokens)
- "The reason this is happening is because" (7 wasted tokens)
- "I would recommend that you consider" (7 wasted tokens)
- "Sure, let me take a look at that for you" (10 wasted tokens)

Caveman say what need saying. Then stop.

## Star This Repo

If caveman save you mass token, mass money — leave mass star. ⭐
